abstract = {Summary Estimating heritability of traits in wild populations is a major prerequisite to understand their evolution. Until recently, most heritability estimates had been obtained using parent-offspring regressions. However, the popularity of animal models, that is, (generalized) linear mixed models assessing the genetic variance component based on population pedigree information, has markedly increased in the past few years. Animal models are claimed to perform better than parent–offspring regressions mainly because they use full between-individual relatedness information and they allow explicit modelling of the environmental effects shared by individuals. However, the differences between heritability estimates obtained using both approaches are not straight forward, and the factors influencing these differences remain unclear. We performed a simulation study to evaluate and compare the accuracy and precision of estimates obtained from parent–offspring regressions and animal models using both Frequentist (REML, PQL) and Bayesian (MCMC) estimation methods. We explored the influence of (i) the presence and type of shared environmental effects (non-transgenerational or transgenerational), (ii) the distribution of the phenotypic trait considered (Gaussian or binary trait) and (iii) data quantity and quality (sample size, pedigree connectivity) on heritability estimates obtained from the two approaches for different levels of true heritability. In the absence of shared environmental effects, the animal model using the REML method performed best for a Gaussian trait, while the animal model using MCMC was more appropriate for a binary trait. For low quantity and quality data, and a binary trait, the parent–offspring regression yielded very imprecise estimates. Estimates from the parent–offspring regression were not influenced by a non-transgenerational shared environmental effect, whereas estimates from animal models in which environmental effects are ignored were affected by both non-transgenerational and transgenerational effects. We discuss the relevance of each approach and estimation method for estimating heritability in wild populations. Importantly, because most effects fitted in animal models are, in fact, non-transgenerational (including environmental maternal effects), we advocate a systematic comparison between parent–offspring regression and animal model estimates to detect potentially missing non-transgenerational environmental effects.},

abstract = {Abstract: The effective size of a population (Ne) rather than the census size (N) determines its rate of genetic drift. Knowing the ratio of effective to census size, Ne  /  N, is useful for estimating the effective size of a population from census data and for examining how different ecological factors influence effective size. Two different multigenerational ratios have been used in the literature based on either the arithmetic mean or the harmonic mean in the denominator. We clarify the interpretation and meaning of these ratios. The arithmetic mean Ne  /  N ratio compares the total number of real individuals to the long-term effective size of the population. The harmonic mean Ne  /  N ratio summarizes variation in the Ne  /  N ratio for each generation. In addition, we show that the ratio of the harmonic mean population size to the arithmetic mean population size provides a useful measure of how much fluctuation in size reduced the effective size of a population. We discuss applications of these ratios and emphasize how to use the harmonic mean Ne  /  N ratio to estimate the effective size of a population over a period of time for which census counts have been collected.},

When sampling is from a normal distribution, our results indicate that, for equal sample sizes, the t test is insensitive to variance heterogeneity and hence no preliminary test is necessary. For unequal sample sizes, the F test has small probability of detecting many alternatives for which the t test performs poorly, and so the F test is not an effective preliminary test. When sampling is from other distributions, our results confirm the sensitivity of the F test to the normality assumption.},

abstract = {Abstract Checking that models adequately represent data is an essential component of applied statistical inference. Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian statistical models in their research. The appeal of this modeling paradigm is undeniable, as researchers can build and fit models that embody complex ecological processes while simultaneously accounting for observation error. However, ecologists tend to be less focused on checking model assumptions and assessing potential lack of fit when applying Bayesian methods than when applying more traditional modes of inference such as maximum likelihood. There are also multiple ways of assessing the fit of Bayesian models, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. For instance, Bayesian P values are relatively easy to compute, but are well known to be conservative, producing P values biased toward 0.5. Alternatively, lesser known approaches to model checking, such as prior predictive checks, cross-validation probability integral transforms, and pivot discrepancy measures may produce more accurate characterizations of goodness-of-fit but are not as well known to ecologists. In addition, a suite of visual and targeted diagnostics can be used to examine violations of different model assumptions and lack of fit at different levels of the modeling hierarchy, and to check for residual temporal or spatial autocorrelation. In this review, we synthesize existing literature to guide ecologists through the many available options for Bayesian model checking. We illustrate methods and procedures with several ecological case studies including (1) analysis of simulated spatiotemporal count data, (2) N-mixture models for estimating abundance of sea otters from an aircraft, and (3) hidden Markov modeling to describe attendance patterns of California sea lion mothers on a rookery. We find that commonly used procedures based on posterior predictive P values detect extreme model inadequacy, but often do not detect more subtle cases of lack of fit. Tests based on cross-validation and pivot discrepancy measures (including the “sampled predictive P value”) appear to be better suited to model checking and to have better overall statistical performance. We conclude that model checking is necessary to ensure that scientific inference is well founded. As an essential component of scientific discovery, it should accompany most Bayesian analyses presented in the literature.},
